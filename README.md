# HoneyPot
This Python-based honeypot simulates vulnerable services to attract and log cyber threats. It records connection attempts, IP addresses, and attack patterns, providing insights into potential threats. Ideal for learning about network security and enhancing defensive strategies.
 1- Service Emulation: Mimics common services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) to attract attackers.
 2- Connection Logging: Records IP addresses, timestamps, and payloads of access attempts.
 3- Intrusion Detection: Identifies suspicious activities in real-time.
 4- Data Analysis: Analyzes attack patterns for security insights.
 5- Alert System: Notifies on potential threats for quick response.
